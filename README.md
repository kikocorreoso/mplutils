**`mplutils`** is a library to help with some matplotlib stuff that sometimes could be hard to achieve as 
most of the time people uses just the `matplotlib.pyplot` module in a basic way and it is difficult to 
remember some advanced functionality.

Most of the included stuff are recipes found on:

* The [matplotlib official webpage](http://matplotlib.org/).
* Nicolas Rougier excellent matplotlib [tutorial](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/matplotlib.html) and [gallery](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/coding/gallery/).
* [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/matplotlib).
* ...

To check some of the actual capabilities you can have a look at the included [notebook in the *notebooks* folder](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kikocorreoso/mplutils/blob/master/notebooks/Examples_of_use.ipynb).

## Installation
